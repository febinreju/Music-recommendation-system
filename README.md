# ðŸŽ¶ Music Recommender System

This repository contains a **Music Recommender System** that suggests songs based on the user's input. The system leverages **Spotify API** for fetching album covers and artist information, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for recommendation, and a pre-trained similarity model. The web interface is built using **Streamlit** for easy user interaction.

## Features

- **Song Recommendation**: Input a song, and the system recommends five similar songs.
- **Album Cover Display**: For each recommended song, the corresponding album cover is fetched from the **Spotify API**.
- **Interactive Web App**: The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use, interactive experience.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes song similarity matrix for generating recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Spotify Million Song Dataset**, which contains extensive metadata on millions of songs. You can download the dataset from **Kaggle**:

[Kaggle Dataset: Spotify Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset)

### Dataset Description

- **Columns**:  
  - `song`: The title of the song.
  - `artist`: The name of the artist who performed the song.
  - Other metadata that may include song duration, genre, etc.

### Model Information

- The similarity between songs is computed based on pre-processed features from the dataset.
- Similarity is stored as a matrix, which is loaded from a pre-trained file using `pickle`.
